# Airline Sentiment Analysis

1. I have performed sentiment analysis on airline feedback reviews. After extracting reviews from website, I have filtered them and visualized to check if there is more positive or negative feedback.
2. I have built a tableau dashboard which help track metrics and understand about the overall performance. Link for dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pranjali.deshmukh2276/viz/BritishAirwaysReviews_17387978130000/Dashboard1
3. I have also built an predictive model to identify if a customer will book or not with the airline, in this I have balanced an imbalace dataset by using oversampling technique SMOTE, and then built a model using Random Forest, whihc has an accuracy of 87.87% .
